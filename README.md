Project Description:
Projects are assigned to students so that they can get a nice and deep knowledge regarding the practical implementation of the theoretical lectures that are taught throughout the course. The main motive of the assignment of projects is to acknowledge the efficiency of students in the taught lessons. Objected-Oriented Programming is an extremely efficient and extensive mode of programming that provides the user to relate the programming terms with real life objects and functionalities. “The WarLand” is a representation of the ancient times when the only method of announcing your superiority was considered to be the amount of man-power you possess and the brilliance of strategy to command and conquer. The game focuses on the concept of war and to relive the greatness of the epic battles which were fought in the past. Basically, the game follows basic concepts of OOP to improve its functionality and smoothness.
